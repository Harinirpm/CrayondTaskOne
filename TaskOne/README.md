Food Ordering Application

# Project Overview: 
The food ordering application allows users to view various food items, add them to a cart, and proceed with payment. The app delivers a smooth user experience with an intuitive interface and responsive design, built using React.js and styled using Material UI for sleek, modern components.

# Technologies Used:
React.js: Frontend library for building the user interface, handling the state, and ensuring a dynamic user experience.
Material UI: Framework for creating elegant, responsive UI components, such as buttons, forms, and modal dialogs, giving the app a professional look and feel.

# Features:
# Food Items Display Page:
Displays a list of available food items with images, descriptions, and prices.
Material UI Card component is used to present food items neatly.
Users can filter or search for food items using the Material UI TextField or Select components.

# Add to Cart Functionality:
Each food item has an "Add to Cart" button (using Material UI’s Button component).
Once clicked, the item is added to the cart, and the app dynamically updates the cart count.
Implemented state management with React Hooks (like useState and useEffect) to manage the items in the cart.

# Cart Page:
The cart page displays all the food items added by the user.
Each item is shown in a Material UI Table or Grid for easy readability.
Users can increase/decrease the quantity or remove items from the cart.
Cart total is dynamically updated based on the quantity of the items added.
Payment Page:

A simple payment interface with form fields for entering payment details (using Material UI TextField).
Implemented basic form validation using React’s state and Material UI form components.
Integration of a payment gateway (like Stripe or Razorpay) to handle payments securely.
Upon successful payment, the user is redirected to an order confirmation page.
